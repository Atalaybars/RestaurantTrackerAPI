# RestaurantTrackerAPI
This is a fantastic api with a super clean and simple design. 
And if you want to keep track of restaurants that you like then this API is for you!  
I followed the Layered Architectural pattern. 
You might go like will you not make an API with Microservices? 
I would love to! So wait for it :)
